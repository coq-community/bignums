# Since Coq 8.13, the configure "-native-compiler" flag is propagated
# to coqc, so this flag should not be unconditionally set in this
# file, all the more as it would raise a compilation error if Coq has
# been compiled with "-native-compiler ondemand" (as in this case, the
# Coq stdlib is not precompiled). The COQEXTRAFLAGS line below is thus
# commented-out. For details, see https://github.com/coq/ceps/pull/48

# COQEXTRAFLAGS += -native-compiler yes
